# Data-Science
A repository to store my code, data and notes for various data science, analytics and visualization projects. (Non-work projects only).

My professional work for my current and previous businesses contains a far more extensive set of projects and analysis than is stored here,
but for privacy reasons I cannot store any of that data or code here. This repository is purely intended for my personal projects and courses
that I have completed to expand my data science knowledge and provide a portfolio for public viewing to showcase my experience and methods.

Anyone reading this who would like to know more about what I do or any of the projects I've published here, please pop me a note at
matthewaallen92@gmail.com, I'm always keen to learn more in these areas and find new projects to collaborate on!
