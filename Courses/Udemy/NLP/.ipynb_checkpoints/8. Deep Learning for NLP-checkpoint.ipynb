    "* Neural networks are a core example of deep learning\n",
    "* Deep learning is loosely defined as a network with >3 hidden layers, ensuring that the analysis compeleted is fine-grained and applies many steps of processing\n",
    "* The broad process is that you have an input layer (raw input data) which is passed through hidden layers (multiple stages of abstraction) before being output in the output layer as the final values\n",
    "* Hidden layers apply weights and a custom activation function to the inputs in order to transform them\n",
    "* Activation functions come in many flavours and there is much to be said for each, but **ReLU** is a commonly used one:\n",
    "    * ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is essentially defined as Max(0,x)\n",
    "    * Where any value <0 is set to 0 and any value above retains its value\n",
    "    * It's a method of removing issues with negative values whilst focusing on the linear relationship between the data\n",

    "* Keras allows you to design neural networks and utilize the TensorFlow framework to run them\n",
    "* Dense layers are synonymous with hidden layers, allowing you to define the transformations that will occur\n",
    "* Below, input_dim=4 means we are passing in 4 dimensions of inputs (because our features have 4 columns)\n",
    "* The activation function used is ReLU (described above)\n",
    "* The number of nodes is set at 8, this can be any number, but a multiple of the input dimensions is often sensible\n",
    "* The final hidden layer is given a softmax function, this determines probabilities of class outcomes and is therefore useful for our data where we are trying to predict one of three output classes (it will return e.g. [0.2, 0.3, 0.5] probabilities for each class value)\n",
    "* Finally, the loss function, optimizer and metrics are defined in the output layer\n",
    "    * Loss function calculates model error and allows enhancement\n",

    "    * Optimizers enhance the network in custom ways (often in an adaptive manner)\n",
    "        * Adam is a modern, general purpose optimizer which enhances standard gradient descent via the addition of momentum and friction to help it avoid convergence at local minima instead of the correct global minima\n",
